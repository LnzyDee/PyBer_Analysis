# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Summarizing how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## PyBer Analysis Results

Urban ride-sharing surpasses the Rural and Suburban. Suburban comes out ahead of Rural. These results show what would be expected in these city types. Urban areas are more populated and dense, allowing for more users. Suburban areas are less populated than Urban areas, but often located just outside of urban areas, cities, allowing for a decent amount of users. Rural areas are well outside of cities and very spread out, less populated, so unsurprisingly the amount of ride-sharing usage there is significantly less than their counterparts. Rural areas also spend more to get rides compared to urban; price difference could be due to less usage in the rural areas and trying to make up that gap. Results shown below:

## PyBer Analysis Summary

Considering Rural areas are more spread out, it might be useful for them to have more ride-sharing availability to allow for travel to wherever they need. Maybe finding more drivers to provide service to the rural areas. A big opportunity could be seized by getting more drivers as well in the Suburban areas, considering the bigger population compared to rural areas, it would be even more likely to find drivers to provide more of the ride-sharing service. Maybe getting some of the urban drivers nearer to suburban areas to help increase service to that area would help improve the suburban users ability to use the ride-sharing service. Increasing access in the lesser used areas could also help to lower costs for users, creating a better experience for them as well.
